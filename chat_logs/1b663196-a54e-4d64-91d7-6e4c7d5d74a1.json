      "content": "Several approaches exist for writing code to determine if a number is prime. Here are a few examples in Python, with explanations:\n\n**Method 1: Basic trial division**\n\nThis is the simplest method, but it's not the most efficient for very large numbers.  It checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n  \"\"\"Checks if a number is prime using trial division.\"\"\"\n  if n <= 1:\n    return False\n  if n == 2:\n    return True\n  if n % 2 == 0:\n    return False\n  for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):\n    if n % i == 0:\n      return False\n  return True\n\n# Example usage\nnumber = 17\nif is_prime(number):\n  print(f\"{number} is a prime number\")\nelse:\n  print(f\"{number} is not a prime number\")\n```\n\n**Method 2: Optimized trial division (6k \u00b1 1 optimization)**\n\nAll primes greater than 3 can be expressed in the form 6k \u00b1 1, where k is any integer. This optimization reduces the number of divisions needed.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime_optimized(n):\n  \"\"\"Checks if a number is prime using optimized trial division (6k \u00b1 1).\"\"\"\n  if n <= 1:\n    return False\n  if n <= 3:\n    return True\n  if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n    return False\n  i = 5\n  while i * i <= n:\n    if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n      return False\n    i += 6\n  return True\n\n#Example usage\nnumber = 97\nif is_prime_optimized(number):\n  print(f\"{number} is a prime number\")\nelse:\n  print(f\"{number} is not a prime number\")\n```\n\n**Method 3: Using the `sympy` library (for very large numbers)**\n\nFor extremely large numbers, using a library like `sympy` is recommended for better performance.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef is_prime_sympy(n):\n  \"\"\"Checks if a number is prime using the sympy library.\"\"\"\n  return sympy.isprime(n)\n\n# Example usage\nnumber = 1000000007\nif is_prime_sympy(number):\n  print(f\"{number} is a prime number\")\nelse:\n  print(f\"{number} is not a prime number\")\n\n```\n\nRemember to install `sympy` if you haven't already: `pip install sympy`\n\nChoose the method that best suits your needs.  For most everyday applications, Method 1 or 2 is sufficient.  For very large numbers, Method 3 is far more efficient.  Method 2 provides a good balance between simplicity and efficiency."

      "content": "Several ways exist to write a prime number code, depending on the desired functionality and efficiency. Here are a few examples in Python:\n\n**Method 1: Basic (inefficient for large numbers)**\n\nThis method checks for divisibility from 2 up to `n-1`.  It's simple but becomes very slow for large numbers.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime_basic(n):\n  \"\"\"Checks if n is a prime number (inefficient for large n).\"\"\"\n  if n <= 1:\n    return False\n  for i in range(2, n):\n    if n % i == 0:\n      return False\n  return True\n\n# Example usage\nprint(is_prime_basic(2))   # True\nprint(is_prime_basic(15))  # False\nprint(is_prime_basic(97))  # True\n```\n\n**Method 2: Optimized (more efficient)**\n\nThis improves efficiency by only checking divisibility up to the square root of `n`.  If a number has a divisor greater than its square root, it must also have a divisor smaller than its square root.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime_optimized(n):\n  \"\"\"Checks if n is a prime number (more efficient).\"\"\"\n  if n <= 1:\n    return False\n  if n == 2:\n    return True\n  if n % 2 == 0:\n    return False\n  for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):\n    if n % i == 0:\n      return False\n  return True\n\n# Example usage\nprint(is_prime_optimized(2))   # True\nprint(is_prime_optimized(15))  # False\nprint(is_prime_optimized(97))  # True\nprint(is_prime_optimized(1000000007)) #True (much faster than basic method for large numbers)\n```\n\n\n**Method 3:  Generating primes within a range (Sieve of Eratosthenes)**\n\nThe Sieve of Eratosthenes is a highly efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified integer.\n\n```python\ndef primes_upto(limit):\n  \"\"\"Generates all prime numbers up to limit using Sieve of Eratosthenes.\"\"\"\n  prime = [True] * (limit + 1)\n  prime[0] = prime[1] = False\n\n  for i in range(2, int(limit**0.5) + 1):\n    if prime[i]:\n      for multiple in range(i*i, limit + 1, i):\n        prime[multiple] = False\n\n  primes = [p for p in range(limit + 1) if prime[p]]\n  return primes\n\n# Example usage\nprint(primes_upto(50)) #[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]\n```\n\nChoose the method that best suits your needs.  For very large numbers, consider using more advanced primality testing algorithms (like the Miller-Rabin test) which are probabilistic but much faster.  The Sieve of Eratosthenes is excellent if you need a list of all primes up to a certain limit. Remember to install any necessary libraries if you choose a more advanced method."
